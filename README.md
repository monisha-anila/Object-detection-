[Project Video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jBOlKuHy33SRoDkJCYUAgzCp4XvcoD3m)
### Project objective
- A weighbridge is one of the key critical areas for crop selling to the framers.
- A lot of mischievous activities happening at this stage which resulted in farmer's suicide rate increased by 15% every year. 
- We want to solve the weighbridge problem using object detection by the YOLO framework a neural network and deep learningmodel which runs on a cloud for processing and images captured by Raspberry Pi.
- This framework guides the user to avoid the weighbridge misplacement.

### Project environment 
- Using Anaconda Navigator with YOLO,Tensorflow a video guide for object detection.
- The following link holds important files:[Google drive]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jBOlKuHy33SRoDkJCYUAgzCp4XvcoD3m).
- The reference video is **TeamGo.mp4**. 
    - You need a Windows10 PC with **8GB RAM and Nvidia GPU**.
    - First of all create a **separate work environment** on Anaconda Navigator to run YOLO work-flow.
    - Download YOLO files of *.cfg* and *.weights* for object detection from offical website.[YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
    - Install tensorflow-gpu, conda numpy etc prescribed in *TeamGo.mp4*.
    - Inorder to use C++ files of YOLO we need to install Visual Studio developer version 13+ version.
    - Use **help.txt** file commands info.
